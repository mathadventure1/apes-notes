## Notes

### <u>Hydrogen Bonds & Water:</u>
- Hydrogen Bonds: Weak chemical bonds that form when hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded to one atom are attracted to another atom on another molecule.
- Surface tension: a property of water that results from the cohesion of water molecules at the surface of a body of water and that creates a sort of skin on the water's surface. 
- Capillary Action: a property of water that occurs when adhesion of water molecules to a surface is stronger than cohesion between the molecules
- Many substances dissolve well in water because of their polar molecules allowing them to bond easily.
### <u>Acids, Bases, and pH:</u>
- Acid: substance that contributes hydrogen ions to a solution
- Base: substance that contributes hydroxide to a solution
- pH: The number that indicates the relative strength of acids and bases in a substance
	- Above 7 = basic
	- Below = acidic
	- 7 = water
- Ocean acidification: increase in the acidity of the oceans
### <u>Environmental Systems - Extra Notes:</u>
- Inorganic compound: a compound that does not contain the element carbon or contains carbon bound to elements other than hydrogen
- Organic compound: a compound that contains carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds.
### <u>Biological Molecules and Cells:</u>
- Carbohydrate: compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms
- Protein: a critical component of living organisms made up of a long chain of nitrogen containing organic molecules known as amino acids
- Nucleic acid
- DNA
- RNA
- Lipid

### <u>Thermodynamics:</u>
- Energy = How much power you're using in total in an activity
- Joule: the amount of energy used when a 1-watt electrical device is turned on for 1 second
- Power = Rate which you're doing it over a certain time
- Energy = power x time
- Power = energy/time
- Types of Energy
	- Electromagnetic radiation: a form of energy emitted by the Sun that includes, but is not limited to, visible light, UV light, IR energy
	- Photon: massless packet of energy that carries electromagnetic radiation at the speed of light
	- Potential energy
	- Chemical energy
	- Kinetic energy
	- Temperature
- Second law of thermodynamics: the physical law stating that when energy is transformed, the quantity of energy remains the same, but its ability to do work diminishes. Entropy
### <u>System Dynamics:</u>
- Open system: a system which exchanges of matter or energy occur across system boundaries
- Closed: do not occur across system boundaries
- Input
- Output
- System analysis: studies the inputs/outputs and change within it
- Steady state: input = output
- Negative feedback loop: systems responds to change by returning to previous, or going down
- Positive feedback loop: change is amplified
