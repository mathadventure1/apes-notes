### <u>Producer:</u>
==An organism that uses the energy of the Sun to produce usable forms of energy. Also known as Autotroph==
### <u>Photosynthesis:</u>
==The process by which producers use solar energy to convert into usable energy, sugar==

### <u>Trophic Levels:</u>
- Consumer
- Herbivore
- Carnivore
- Secondary consumer
- Tertiary consumer
- Food web
- Scavenger
- **Detritivore:**
	- An organism that specializes in breaking down dead tissues and waste products into smaller pieces
- **Decomposers:**
	- Fungi and bacteria that convert organic matter into small elements and molecules that can be recycles back into the ecosystem
- Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)
	- Total amount of solar energy that producers in an ecosystem capture via photosynthesis over a given amount of time 
- **Biogeochemical Cycle**
	- The movements of matter within and between ecosystems
- **Hydrologic Cycle:**
	- The movement of water through the biosphere
	- Human impact: deforestation removes transpiration from the cycle, which leads to less rain, and a big impact on the rest of the cycle
- Transpiration: 
	- The release of water from leaves during photosynthesis
- Evapotranspiration
	- The combined amount of evaporation and transpiration
- Runoff: 
	- Water that moves across the land surface into streams and river
- **Carbon Cycle:**
	- Producers take up carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis and pass it on to consumers and decomposers. Some inorganic carbon sediments precipitate out of the water to form sedimentary rock with some organic carbon may be buried and become fossil fuels.
### <u>The Nitrogen Cycle</u>
- The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen from the atmosphere and into soils through several fixation pathways, including the production of fertilizers by humans. In the soil, nitrogen can exist in several forms. Denitrifying bacteria release nitrogen gas back into the atmosphere.
- **Lagooms**
		- Nitrogen fixing bacteria gives a good concentration of bacteria that can convert atmospheric nitrogen into ones that plants can use.
### <u>Phosphorus Cycle:</u>
- The phosphorus cycle begins with the weathering or mining of phosphate rocks and use of phosphate fertilizer which releases phosphorus into the soil and water. this phosphorus can be used by producers and subsequently moves through the food web. In water, phosphorus can precipitate out of solution and form sediments which over time are transformed into new phosphate rocks
- Algal Bloom
	- A rapid increase in the algal populatio nof a waterway
- Hypoxic
	- Low in ocygen
- Dead zone
	- When oxygen concentrations become so low that it kills fish and other aquatic animals
### <u>Sulfur Cycle</u>
Most sulfur exists as rocks. As these rocks are weathered over time, they release sulfate ions that producers can take up and assimilate.
